# The Odin Project Admin dashboard


A design mockup of an admin dashboard. This project belongs to [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard) curriculum.

The purpose of the project is to apply more advanced CSS and HTML techniques and especially CSS Grid, to create a functional layout.

## What I learned during this project:

- using CSS Grid for layouts
- the strengths of both Grid and Flexbox and when to use which
- using Google Material Design icons
- refined my understanding of many possibilities CSS and HTML offer
